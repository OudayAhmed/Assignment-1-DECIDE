## Workflow
During our first meeting we discussed and came up with some standards to make the workflow easy:
* Descriptive Issues with tags related to what needs to be done
* Branch names with Issue number 
* For each PR assign a reviewer
* Stand-ups to be held when need, communicated through Discord. 


# Contribution
During the first meeting we assigned two to create issues and tags needed. Then dividing all of the CMV related issues equally among all group members. For the remaining issues we split them in documentation related and code related issues.
